# SDC_Notebook_001_ColorSelection

This notebook is the first notebook corresponding to the "Computer Vision Fundamentals" of Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree, in which we begin exploring the concepts of image processing and computer vision.

The heart of this notebook is the simple color thresholding of an image -- that is, only considering pixels above a certain color intensity range. (In the case of the notebook, we're concerned with white, the color of the lane lines in the image.)

As one can note, we're yet to implement any OpenCV functionality.
